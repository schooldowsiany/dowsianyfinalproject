<p>Welcome to my food-themed website! I have been meal prepping for about 3 years and have been losing weight and keeping it off. Pairing these foods with light to moderate excerxise each week<br>
should help you keep the weight off. These are easy to make meals where all you really need is a crockpot and your hands. After portioning out what you make, you should have meals for at least a week<br>
to eat. Making a few of these at a time and you'll be eating good for weeks!
